# web-APIs-code-quiz
The goal of this project was to create a timed coding quiz as an additional studying and knowledge refreshing tool. The quiz was build so that it would add 10s to the timer for every correct answer and substract 10s for every wrong answer. The remaining time at the end of the quiz is the final score of the quiz. Additionally, the quiz can collect the user's initials and stores it in local storage to remain accessible even after closing the page.
